## The Problem
Climate change is one of the most talked about topics due to its potential to significantly impact the planet and all of the life on it.The Earth's climate is naturally variable, but it has generally remained within a relatively narrow range that has allowed life to thrive. However, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, are releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth's temperature to rise, leading to a range of impacts on the planet's natural systems. Climate change has been causing a multitude of changes to our ecosystems. Sea levels have been rising, causing coastal flooding and erosion and making it more difficult for people living in low-lying areas to remain there.  There have been severe changes in weather patterns, including more frequent and severe storms, droughts, and heatwaves. These changes can affect agriculture, water resources, and other aspects of human life and the natural environment. There has been a huge loss of biodiversity as some species struggle to adapt to changing conditions and others are unable to migrate to new areas as their habitats shift. Severe damage to natural systems that support human life have slowly been taking place over the last 20 to 40 years, such as the loss of coral reefs that provide a home for many species and protect coastlines from storms, or the alteration of forests that provide timber, medicine, and other resources.



## Our Questions
We were curious about many things, but mostly we wanted to discover which countries were the most in need of aid. This information would make it easier for countries sending humanitarian aid to concentrate their efforts and address hunger at it's roots. 
To try to find these locations, the main questions we asked were:
- In which countries are children's development most impacted by hunger?
- Which countries have the most food insecure people
- On the global hunger index, which countries score the highest?
## Our Data
We used data from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment), and we found several datasets that show instances of extreme hunger globally. We used a dataset on stunting - which is loss of development due to malnutrition - in children under 5, and analyzed in which countries the highest percentage of children were impacted. We also looked at a dataset on the number of people who were food insecure by millions, showing who was most at risk for starvation. Finally, we also looked at the global hunger index for each country; the global hunger index is a tool that uses different factors that may be signifiers of hunger like stunting or food insecurity to determine a scale for hunger intensity.
## What We Found
We found that child stunting is a incredibly prevalent; in at least 7 countries over 50% of children had stunted development due to malnutrition. These countries were Bangladesh, Burundi, Eritrea, Guatemala, Madagascar, Timor, and Yemen. (*See Summary Page For More Information*)

We also found that the number of severely food insecure people is increasing overall, not decreasing despite global humanitarian efforts. This may be due to a variety of causes, such as population growth, political changes, and climate disasters. Since 2015, the number of severely food insecure people has surpassed 30 million. (*See Summary Page For More Information*)

However, we noticed that this increase in hunger was not as clean cut as entire world data would have you believe. We found that out of the **World's Top 10 "Hungriest" Nations**, there was not always a trendline showing hunger to be worsening over time. Countries such as Timor even saw a sharp decrease in their global hunger index compared to their standing in 2015. This is more proof as to why looking at data by country is significant to understanding how hunger takes hold and how to best eradicate it. (*See Summary Page For More Information*)
